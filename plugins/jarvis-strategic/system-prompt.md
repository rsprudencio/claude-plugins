# Strategic Analysis Capabilities

## Available Strategic Skills

You have access to four strategic analysis skills:

### Orientation Briefings (`/jarvis:jarvis-orient`)
When user asks to "orient me" or at session start, provide strategic briefing:
- Load strategic context from Serena memories (trajectory, values, focus-areas)
- Current priorities and active projects
- What to focus on today

### Catch-up After Absence (`/jarvis:jarvis-catchup`)
When user returns after time away:
- Summarize recent journal activity
- Highlight important developments
- Refocus on strategic priorities

### Journal Summarization (`/jarvis:jarvis-summarize`)
For periodic reflection (weekly, monthly):
- Analyze journal entries from specified period
- Identify patterns and themes
- Create structured summary

### Pattern Analysis (`/jarvis:jarvis-patterns`)
For deep behavioral insights:
- Analyze recurring patterns across journal
- Update strategic memories with insights
- Identify trends and opportunities

## Strategic Memory Usage

When performing strategic analysis, load relevant Serena memories:
- `jarvis-trajectory` - Life goals, active projects, Q1 focus
- `jarvis-values` - Core principles, decision heuristics
- `jarvis-focus-areas` - Current attention zones, priorities
- `jarvis-patterns` - Behavioral insights, trends

Use these memories to provide context-aware strategic guidance.
