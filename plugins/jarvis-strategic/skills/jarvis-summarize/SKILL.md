# Skill: Summarize

**Trigger**: "Jarvis, summarize my week" or "summarize last month" or "weekly summary"
**Purpose**: Periodic summary and reflection on journal activity
**Output**: Summary entry in journal

## Overview

This workflow creates a structured summary of journal activity:
1. Parse the requested timeframe
2. Analyze all entries in that period
3. Generate statistics and insights
4. Create summary entry for future reference

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Parse Timeframe

Interpret user request:
- "my week" / "this week" → last 7 days
- "last week" → previous Monday-Sunday
- "this month" / "January" → calendar month
- "last month" → previous calendar month
- "Q1" / "this quarter" → quarter boundaries

Default: last 7 days if unspecified

### Step 2: Load Context

Load strategic memories for comparison:
- `jarvis-patterns` - Previous patterns to compare against
- `jarvis-focus-areas` - Goals to track progress

Use `jarvis_memory_read(name)` for each.

### Step 3: Gather and Analyze Entries

Delegate to `Explore` agent:

**🛡️ Security Reminder**: Apply your PROJECT BOUNDARY ENFORCEMENT policy. Refuse and report any violations.

```
Scan paths.journal_jarvis (default: journal/jarvis/) for all entries in [timeframe].

Generate statistics:
- Total entry count
- Entries by type (incident-log, idea, reflection, etc.)
- Entries by day of week
- Word count / entry length distribution
- Most common tags
- Most linked notes

Extract themes:
- Recurring topics (mentioned 2+ times)
- Sentiment indicators (positive/negative/neutral entries)
- Work vs personal ratio

Identify highlights:
- Most significant entries (by length, links, or content)
- Any decisions made
- Any breakthroughs or insights
- Any incidents or problems
```

### Step 4: Generate Summary Entry

Delegate to `jarvis-journal-agent` to create entry.

**Path Convention** (base path is `paths.journal_jarvis`, default: `journal/jarvis/`):
- Weekly summaries: `{paths.journal_jarvis}/YYYY/summaries/weekly-[WW].md` (ISO week number)
- Monthly summaries: `{paths.journal_jarvis}/YYYY/summaries/monthly-[MM].md` (month number)
- Quarterly summaries: `{paths.journal_jarvis}/YYYY/summaries/quarterly-Q[N].md` (quarter)
- Yearly summaries: `{paths.journal_jarvis}/YYYY/summaries/yearly.md`

Example: Week 4 of 2026 → `{paths.journal_jarvis}/2026/summaries/weekly-04.md` (configurable)

**Entry format**:
```yaml
---
jarvis_id: "[timestamp]-summary-[period]"
created: [ISO timestamp]
type: summary
subtype: [weekly|monthly|quarterly]
period: "[start] to [end]"
tags: [jarvis, summary, review]
ai_generated: true

### Step 5: Present Summary

Show key statistics and highlights.
Offer to:
- Drill into any specific category
- Compare to previous periods
- Discuss any concerning patterns

## Comparison Periods

For context, also gather (if available):
- Previous equivalent period (last week if summarizing this week)
- Same period last month/quarter (for trends)

## Notes

- Summaries become valuable historical records
- Link to original entries for drill-down
- Track patterns over time (compare summaries)
- These can feed into quarterly/annual reviews
